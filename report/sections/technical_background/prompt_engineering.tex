Prompt engineering is essential for maximizing AI model response quality. Through strategic prompt 
design, we can direct AI systems to deliver more relevant, organized, and contextually appropriate 
outputs. This project examines various prompting methodologies and their optimization using LLaMA 
2 alongside LangChain to enhance AI-human communication effectiveness.

\subsubsection{Why Prompt Engineering Matters?}
The responses generated by AI models like Large language models (chatgpt ,LLma2) depend heavily on their input. Well-crafted 
prompts significantly affect the quality of AI-generated content. Effective prompt engineering allows 
us to enhance response precision through clear directives, deepen AI's contextual comprehension to 
better align with user intentions, streamline computational resources by eliminating unnecessary 
processing, and gain greater influence over AI behavior to achieve desired results. These benefits 
make prompt engineering crucial for AI applications including chatbots, virtual assistants, code 
generators, and automated content summarizers. 

The model generates a response with no prior examples.
A few examples are provided to guide the model toward the desired response.
The model is encouraged to reason step-by-step, improving accuracy in complex problem-solving \cite{wei2022chain}.
AI generates multiple responses and selects the most logical one.
