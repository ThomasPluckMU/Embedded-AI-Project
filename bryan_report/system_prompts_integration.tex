\subsection{System Prompts Integration}

A key addition to our implementation was the integration of a dedicated system prompt editor within the interface. This editor enables administrators to easily create, manage, and refine system prompts specifically designed for generating insightful and actionable sales information from interactions with the AI model.

The system prompts are stored securely in a dedicated prompt library accessible through the application's settings panel. Administrators can seamlessly activate specific prompts for API interactions without these being visible during use. This design ensures the frontend interface remains clean and focused on user interaction, while backend operations utilize highly targeted prompts to optimize AI responses.

By implementing this structured and hidden prompt library, our solution significantly enhances the flexibility and precision of AI-generated sales insights. The prompt editor provides administrators with an intuitive means of iterating and improving prompt quality over time, directly contributing to the continuous improvement and customization of AI outputs aligned with evolving business requirements.
