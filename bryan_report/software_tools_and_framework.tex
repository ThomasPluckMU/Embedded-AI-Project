\subsection{Software Tools and Framework}

The development of our B2B Sales Generative AI Assistant prototype utilized BetterChatGPT as a foundational software framework. BetterChatGPT, an open-source interface designed to enhance interactions with large language models (LLMs), provided a robust starting point due to its modular design, extensibility, and clear separation of concerns.

To fit the specific requirements outlined in our project, we significantly extended and altered the BetterChatGPT codebase. Our customizations included integrating AssemblyAIâ€™s Transcript API to handle real-time audio transcription of sales interactions. This enabled the conversion of verbal exchanges into structured textual data, facilitating further analysis.

These adjustments allowed us to optimize the system for responsiveness and accuracy in a conversational B2B sales environment. The modular software architecture was crucial in managing complexity, enabling independent development, testing, and continuous improvement of system components while maintaining cohesive overall functionality.
